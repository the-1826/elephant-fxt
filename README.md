# Elephant .fxt Tool

Russian text isn't supported in the 3D GTA games natively, so there's a need to use various non-default encodings. This might seem to be a bit too hard to do for .fxt files used with the CLEO plugins. 

This tool is aimed to solve that problem by providing a converter for the Russian text to various encodings used by all kind of GTA translations.

## Features:

* Fast converting speed
* File is saved in Windows-1251 encoding to evade any issues with THE classic 3D GTAs fonts support

## Supported encodings:

* 1C/Buka (GTA 3)
